Perform Matter device commissioning and control using .Net

I'm not sure this can even be made to work, but I'd love to be able to perform some basic commissioning of Matter devices using .Net

There are a few pieces to get working.

#1 using Bluetooth to discover the device.

#2 Connect to the device

#3 Connect it to a network (WiFi or Thread)

#4 Find it after connection

#5 Connect to the device
